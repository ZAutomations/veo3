/**
 * REFS FOR A SCENE - which reference images a clip needs, and how to tell they landed
 * ==================================================================================
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The engine used to decide what to attach from the story's
 * own `character_references` map, matching the picker on the local file's
 * basename. Measured on stories/the_price_of_obligation, that lost two things:
 *
 * 1. THE PLACE WAS NEVER ATTACHED. Its `character_references` holds exactly two
 *    entries - godwin and tari - and no place. The place IS a real ref
 *    (refs.json: kind "place", the bedroom plate), and the story's own sheets
 *    file says why it matters: "This is the ONE place this film happens in.
 *    Every clip is shot here, with the same furniture and the same light."
 *    Iterating character_references cannot see it, so the room was never handed
 *    to the model and each clip re-invented it.
 *
 * 2. THE FILES IT NAMED DO NOT EXIST. The story records
 *    "./character_refs/godwin.jpg" and "./character_refs/tari.jpg", and
 *    stories/the_price_of_obligation/character_refs/ IS EMPTY. So the upload
 *    step resolved nothing and logged a warning per name while the run carried
 *    on. The only reason any ingredient was attached at all is that the tiles
 *    had been made in the Flow project by hand - which is exactly the manual
 *    step generate_refs.js automates for Agent Mode, and what the Scenes route
 *    now uses it for too.
 *
 * So refs come from the story's refs.json when it has one - the same file the
 * ref generator reads, so both routes agree on the cast AND the place - with
 * the sheets file and the story's map as fallbacks.
 *
 * MATCHING. A tile's on-screen name is not the local filename: the generator
 * RENAMES each tile to the ref's own simple name ("Godwin"), while the story
 * records a path ("character_refs/godwin.jpg"). Matching one exact spelling is
 * how a ref goes missing with nobody noticing, so candidates are tried from
 * most specific to least and compared on a key that ignores case, spaces,
 * punctuation and underscores.
 *
 * VERIFYING. Whether a tick actually became an ingredient is READ BACK off the
 * prompt box, never assumed from the fact that a click was dispatched. That is
 * the fix for "extending only adds one @img, sometimes the male, sometimes the
 * female": the old code counted a click it could not observe and then moved on.
 *
 * THE CAP IS THREE. The story's sheets file states it: "the video model accepts
 * at most 3 reference images, and the place plate takes one of those slots - so
 * a cast of 2 or 3 is the ceiling." refsForScene reports an over-cap request
 * rather than silently dropping one.
 *
 * No browser, no network, no story file needed - see test_refs_for_scene.js.
